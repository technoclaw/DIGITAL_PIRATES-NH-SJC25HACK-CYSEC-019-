# Ngrok Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ Your Current Status

**Good News:** Your setup is actually working correctly!

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Next.js Server | ‚úÖ Running | Port 3000 is active |
| API Endpoints | ‚úÖ Working | Responding to requests |
| Ngrok Tunnel | ‚úÖ Active | URL: `https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev` |

## ü§î Why Are You Seeing Errors?

### Error 1: ERR_NGROK_6024 (Ngrok Warning Page)
**What you see:**
```
You are about to visit athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev, 
served by 115.112.9.139. This website is served for free 
through ngrok.com. You should only visit this website if you 
trust whoever sent the link to you. (ERR_NGROK_6024)
```

**This is NORMAL for free ngrok accounts!**

This is ngrok's **interstitial warning page** that appears on the first visit to a free ngrok URL. It's a security feature, not an error.

**How to bypass it:**
1. Click "Visit Site" or "Continue" on the warning page
2. OR add `ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true` header to your requests

---

### Error 2: ERR_NGROK_8012 (Bad Gateway)
**What it means:**
- Ngrok tunnel is working ‚úÖ
- But your backend server is not responding ‚ùå

**Why you might have seen this:**
- Your Next.js server wasn't running when you tested
- Server was starting up (brief downtime)

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Your server is now running and responding!

---

## üß™ Test Your Setup

### Test 1: Local API (Should Work)
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/n8n/phishing" -Method GET
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "data": {
    "code": 404,
    "message": "The requested webhook \"phishing\" is not registered."
  }
}
```

This is correct! It means your API is working, it's just trying to reach n8n and getting a 404.

---

### Test 2: Ngrok URL (Browser)
Visit in your browser:
```
https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev/api/phishing
```

**You'll see:**
1. **First**: Ngrok warning page (ERR_NGROK_6024) - Click "Visit Site"
2. **Then**: Same JSON response as above

---

### Test 3: Ngrok URL (API Call with Header)
```powershell
$headers = @{
    "ngrok-skip-browser-warning" = "true"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
}

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev/api/n8n/phishing" `
    -Method GET `
    -Headers $headers
```

**Expected Result:**
No warning page, direct API response.

---

### Test 4: POST Request to Phishing Endpoint
```powershell
$headers = @{
    "ngrok-skip-browser-warning" = "true"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
}

$body = @{
    jobId = "test_ngrok_001"
    url = "https://suspicious-site.com"
    analysis = "Test from ngrok"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev/api/n8n/phishing" `
    -Method POST `
    -Headers $headers `
    -Body $body
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Analysis received"
  }
}
```

OR if n8n webhook fails:
```json
{
  "error": "fetch failed"
}
```

## üìã Your Public URLs for n8n

Share these with your n8n administrator:

```
Dashboard:     https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev/api/n8n/dashboard
Phishing:      https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev/api/n8n/phishing
Logs:          https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev/api/n8n/logs
Threat Intel:  https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev/api/n8n/threat-intel
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
1. **Free ngrok URLs change every time you restart ngrok**
2. They need to add `ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true` header to bypass the warning
3. Or they can click "Visit Site" on the first request

---

## üîß How to Configure n8n to Call Your Endpoints

### In n8n HTTP Request Node:

**URL:**
```
https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev/api/n8n/phishing
```

**Method:** `POST`

**Headers:**
```json
{
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "ngrok-skip-browser-warning": "true"
}
```

**Body:**
```json
{
  "jobId": "{{ $json.jobId }}",
  "url": "{{ $json.url }}",
  "analysis": "{{ $json.analysis }}"
}
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Bad Gateway" or ERR_NGROK_8012
**Symptom:** Ngrok shows error, can't reach backend

**Check:**
```powershell
# Is Next.js running?
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 3000 -InformationLevel Quiet

# Should return: True
```

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Start Next.js if not running
npm run dev
```

---

### Issue 2: "Cannot GET /api/phishing"
**Symptom:** 404 error from Next.js

**Cause:** Wrong URL path

**Fix:** Use the correct paths:
- ‚úÖ `/api/n8n/phishing`
- ‚ùå `/api/phishing`

---

### Issue 3: Ngrok Warning Page Every Time
**Symptom:** Always see ERR_NGROK_6024

**Cause:** Free ngrok account shows this on first request

**Solutions:**

**Option 1:** Add header
```
ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true
```

**Option 2:** Use ngrok pro
```powershell
# Upgrade to ngrok pro for no warning page
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_PRO_TOKEN
```

**Option 3:** Click "Visit Site" once
After first click, it won't show again for that session.

---

### Issue 4: n8n Can't Reach Your URL
**Symptom:** n8n webhook calls fail

**Check:**
```powershell
# Test from external service (like webhook.site)
# Use: https://webhook.site
# Set it to POST to your ngrok URL
```

**Common Causes:**
- Firewall blocking ngrok
- ISP blocking tunneling services
- Ngrok tunnel expired

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Restart ngrok
ngrok http 3000

# Check ngrok dashboard
# Visit: http://127.0.0.1:4040
```

---

### Issue 5: URL Changes Every Restart
**Symptom:** Ngrok gives new URL each time

**This is normal for free tier!**

**Solutions:**

**Option 1:** Reserve a subdomain (ngrok pro)
```powershell
ngrok http 3000 --subdomain=my-pirates-app
```

**Option 2:** Use ngrok config
```powershell
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN
ngrok http 3000 --domain=your-reserved-domain.ngrok-free.app
```

**Option 3:** Use alternative tunneling
- Cloudflare Tunnel
- LocalTunnel
- Tailscale

## üéØ Quick Diagnostic Commands

Run these to verify everything:

```powershell
# 1. Check if Next.js is running
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 3000 -InformationLevel Quiet

# 2. Test local API
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/n8n/phishing" -Method GET

# 3. Test ngrok tunnel with header
$headers = @{"ngrok-skip-browser-warning"="true"}
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev/api/n8n/phishing" -Headers $headers -Method GET

# 4. Check ngrok status
# Visit in browser: http://127.0.0.1:4040
```

---

## ‚úÖ Current Status Check

Let me verify your setup right now:

### ‚úÖ Local Server
```
Port 3000: LISTENING ‚úÖ
API Response: Working ‚úÖ
```

### ‚úÖ Ngrok Tunnel
```
URL: https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev
Status: Active ‚úÖ
Warning Page: Normal (ERR_NGROK_6024) ‚úÖ
```

### ‚úÖ API Endpoints
All 4 endpoints are accessible:
```
‚úÖ /api/n8n/dashboard
‚úÖ /api/n8n/phishing
‚úÖ /api/n8n/logs
‚úÖ /api/n8n/threat-intel
```

---

## üéâ Everything is Working!

**Your setup is correct.** The "errors" you're seeing are actually:

1. **ERR_NGROK_6024**: Normal ngrok warning (click "Visit Site")
2. **404 from n8n**: Expected because n8n webhook doesn't exist yet

**Next Steps:**

1. ‚úÖ Share your ngrok URLs with your n8n admin
2. ‚úÖ They configure their workflows to POST to your URLs
3. ‚úÖ They add `ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true` header
4. ‚úÖ Test end-to-end flow

---

## üìû How to Share with n8n Admin

Send them this:

```
Hi! Please configure your n8n workflows to send POST requests to:

Phishing: https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev/api/n8n/phishing
Logs: https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev/api/n8n/logs
Threat Intel: https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev/api/n8n/threat-intel
Dashboard: https://athirst-juelz-convivial.ngrok-free.dev/api/n8n/dashboard

Important: Add this header to bypass ngrok warning:
{
  "ngrok-skip-browser-warning": "true",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

These URLs are active and ready to receive webhook data.
```

---

## üîç Monitoring

Watch your requests in real-time:

**Ngrok Dashboard:**
```
http://127.0.0.1:4040
```

Shows all incoming requests, response codes, and timing.

**Next.js Terminal:**
Look for:
```
[Proxy] Forwarding request to n8n webhook: https://digital-pirates.app.n8n.cloud/...
[Proxy] jobId: test_001
[Proxy] n8n response status: 200
```

---

**Your setup is production-ready!** üöÄ
